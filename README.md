These two arduino sketches are used to calculate chip temperature and its Vcc voltage and show results on serial terminal.
They works only in arduino UNO, it cannot work other arduino hardware. Because it uses Atmega328 ADC hardware and its measurement channels.
I hope those sketches ispires other people to use the microcontrollers internal hardware...
